## Experiment Project - Socket Programming in Go

Experiment project for create application with **socket** impementation. Sockets allow communication between two different processes on the same or different machines.

A socket is one endpoint of a two way communication link between two programs running on the network. The socket mechanism provides a means of inter-process communication (IPC) by establishing named contact points between which the communication take place.

```
Then run:

After you run client script, it will show like below:
